Hey guys, 

This week we’ll be discussing the concept of "Youtubability" - 
another important game guideline. 

Youtubability A key driver of youtubability is the clarity of your gameplay to a potential player.
Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the full potential of your game by working on getting the lowest possible CPIs for your games.
Many elements can be used to make your game clearer :
For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte-raction with the game is evident,
for example, can she tell which character she controls? Is the objective clear?
Does it look fun to play? Has she understood the game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 seconds (too long!).
Make sure to use colours to help indicate the gameplay rules. 
For instance, in Helix Jump, obstacles are clearly contrasted (in orange here) and instantly recognized as a threat.
